/* var:
 var is used to declare a global variable of any type e.g,[string , int , array , object] 
 and its value can be update and can be re-declare in its scope whenever needed. we can 
 initialize var as undifined.
 code example is given below:
 */
var country;
var country = "India"
console.log(country)

// we can update its value

country = "Pakistan"
console.log(country)

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       
/* let:
        it can be used to declare a variable in a block of code. it can be refer as local variable
        these can be updated but we can not re-declare them. And these are not initialize
         */
// we can not re-declare a variable using let, it gives us error e.g,    
//let country="UK";
//console.log(country)

//but we can declare it in a block of code, like
{
let country="UK";
console.log(country)  
}

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*Const:
        const declares an immutable read-only reference value. we can not update nor 
        re-declare it. like

*/
const name = "Gulzar"
console.log(name)

//trying to update its value, but it will give us an error
name = "Hussain"
console.log(name)
